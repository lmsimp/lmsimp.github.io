              Funded BBSRC CASE (Collaborative Awards in Science and Engineering) Award project under the supervision of Prof. Chris Reynolds (Dept. of Biological Sciences, University of Essex) and Dr. Ian Wall (GSK, Harlow). My main research focused on structure-based drug-design in which I used molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulation techniques to gain an insight into the structural and functional properties of GPCRs in their multiple states.
