          I am involved in many collaborations within the Lilley Lab and work closely with wet lab biologists on downstream data analysis of proteomics data, generated from different technologies and cell lines.

           I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in [Professor Kathryn Lilley]( https://proteomics.bio.cam.ac.uk) group located in Cambridge Centre for Proteomics at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on R package development and the computational analysis of high-throughput quantitative spatial proteomics data. This includes the application and development of new machine learning tools. Our work is contributed to the R Bioconductor project in the form of dedicated software packages (see projects) pioneered by [Prof Laurent Gatto](https://lgatto.github.io/about) at UCLouvain, Belgium.
