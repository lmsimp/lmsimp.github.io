        description:
           I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in [Professor Kathryn Lilley]( https://proteomics.bio.cam.ac.uk) group located in Cambridge Centre for Proteomics at the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on R package development and the computational analysis of high-throughput quantitative spatial proteomics data. This includes the application and development of new machine learning tools. Our work is contributed to the R Bioconductor project in the form of dedicated software packages (see projects) pioneered by [Prof Laurent Gatto](https://lgatto.github.io/about) at UCLouvain, Belgium.

           CASE (Collaborative Awards in Science and Engineering) PhD studentship with GSK (Harlow, UK) working in the Computational Chemistry Division in R&D, under the supervision of Dr Ian Wall and Dr Frank Blaney. My main research focused on using molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulation techniques to gain an insight into the structural and functional properties of GPCRs in their multiple states.
