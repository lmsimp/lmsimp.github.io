career:
 - position: Post Doctoral Research Associate - Computational Biologist 
   company: Computational Proteomics Unit
   location: University of Cambrdige, UK
   dates: November 2010 - current
   summary: The Computational Proteomics Unit (http://cpu.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk) is located at Cambridge Centre for Proteomics (http://proteomics.bio.cam.ac.uk), which operates the development of new proteomics techniques and large scale collaborative projects. 
   accomplishments:
    - accomplishment: Development of bioinformatics and statistical tools, that utilise pattern recognition and machine learning methods to enable robust analysis of high-throughput quantitative proteomics data. 
 - position: Undergraduate Mathematics Supervisor 
   company: Univeristy of Cambridge
   location: Cambridge, UK
   dates: November 2010 - July 2011
   summary: Elementary Mathematics supervisor for Wolfson College and Newnham College, at the University of Cambridge. In my role I was responsible for guiding students in their studies and making assessments of their progress. 
 - position: PhD Computational Biology 
   company: Univeristy of Essex 
   location: Colchester, UK
   dates: October 2010 - August 2010
   summary: Funded BBSRC CASE (Collaborative Awards in Science and Engineering) Award project under the supervision of Prof. Chris Reynolds (Dept. of Biological Sciences, University of Essex) and Dr. Ian Wall (GSK, Harlow). My main research focused on structure-based drug-design in which I used molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulation techniques to gain an insight into the structural and functional properties of GPCRs in their multiple states.
 - position: Industrial CASE Student
   company: GSK 
   location: Colchester, UK
   dates: October 2010 - August 2010
   summary: I spent several months during my PhD (University of Essex, UK), at GSK (Harlow, UK) working in the Computational Chemistry Division in R&D, under the supervision of Dr Ian Wall and Dr Frank Blaney, as part of my industrial CASE (Collaborative Awards in Science and Engineering) studentship. My main research focused on using molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulation techniques to gain an insight into the structural and functional properties of GPCRs in their multiple states.

sideProjects:
  - name: pRolocGUI
    description: The pRolocGUI package is an interactive interface to explore and visualise experimental mass spectrometry-based spatial proteomics data. It relies on the shiny framework for interactive visualisation, the MSnbase package to handle data and metadata and the pRoloc software for spatial proteomics specific data matters. Example spatial data is available in the pRolocdata experiment package.
