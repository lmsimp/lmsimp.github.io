career:
 - position: Post Doctoral Research Associate - Computational
   Proteomics Unit, University of Cambridge company: location:
Cambridge, UK dates: November 2010 - current summary: The
Computational Proteomics Unit (http://cpu.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk) is
located at Cambridge Centre for Proteomics
(http://proteomics.bio.cam.ac.uk), which operates the development of
new proteomics techniques and large scale collaborative projects.
 - position: Undergraduate Mathematics Supervisor - University of
   Cambridge company: location: Cambridge, UK dates: November 2010 -
July 2011 summary: Elementary Mathematics supervisor for Wolfson
College and Newnham College, at the University of Cambridge. In my
role I was responsible for guiding students in their studies and
making assessments of their progress. 
 - position: PhD Computational Biology - University of Essex company:
   location: Colchester, UK dates: October 2010 - August 2010 summary:
Funded BBSRC CASE (Collaborative Awards in Science and Engineering)
Award project under the supervision of Prof. Chris Reynolds (Dept. of
Biological Sciences, University of Essex) and Dr. Ian Wall (GSK,
Harlow). My main research focused on structure-based drug-design in
which I used molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulation
techniques to gain an insight into the structural and functional
properties of GPCRs in their multiple states.
 - position: Industrial CASE Student - GSK company: location: Harlow,
   UK dates: October 2010 - August 2010 summary: I spent several
months during my PhD (University of Essex, UK), at GSK (Harlow, UK)
working in the Computational Chemistry Division in R&D, under the
supervision of Dr Ian Wall and Dr Frank Blaney, as part of my
industrial CASE (Collaborative Awards in Science and Engineering)
studentship. My main research focused on using molecular modelling and
molecular dynamics simulation techniques to gain an insight into the
structural and functional properties of GPCRs in their multiple
states.

sideProjects:
  - name: pRolocGUI description: The pRolocGUI package is an
    interactive interface to explore and visualise experimental mass
spectrometry-based spatial proteomics data. It relies on the shiny
framework for interactive visualisation, the MSnbase package to handle
data and metadata and the pRoloc software for spatial proteomics
specific data matters. Example spatial data is available in the
pRolocdata experiment package.  link:
